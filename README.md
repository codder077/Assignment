# Responsive React Gallery and Tabs Component

## Overview

This project is a responsive web application built with React and Tailwind CSS. The application features a combined component that includes both a gallery and a tabbed interface. The gallery allows users to scroll through images and add new ones, while the tabbed interface displays different content based on the selected tab. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring responsiveness and a modern UI across different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Gallery**: A gallery that displays a scrollable list of images. Users can navigate through images using left and right arrows and can add new images from their device.
- **Tabbed Interface**: A tabbed section that allows users to switch between different content areas like "About Me," "Experiences," and "Recommended."
- **Responsive Design**: The UI components adapt to different screen sizes, making the application functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS to provide a clean, modern look.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
